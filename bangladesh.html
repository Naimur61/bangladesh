						<h2>BIRYANI</h2>
						<p>
							Etymology Biryani is derived from the Farsi Persian language word "brishtah" (برشتہ) meaning
							fried onions, because the dish was made by flavoring rice with fried onions and meat, besides
							mild spices. Persian was used as an official language in different parts of medieval India by
							various Islamic dynasties.[9][10] One theory states that it originated from birinj (Persian:
							برنج), the Persian word for rice.[11][12] Another theory states that it is derived from biryan
							or beriyan (Persian: بریان), which means "to fry" or "to roast".[13][14] Origin The exact origin
							of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim
							centres of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Rampur, Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small
							principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several
							distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish
							originated[15]) as well as Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur, Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala
							(Malabar), Telangana, and Karnataka (Bhatkal) where Muslim communities were present.[11][16]
							According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of
							the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the
							Persian pilaf.[17] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia,
							and was brought to India by the Mughals.[18] Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in
							India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[19] The 16th-century Mughal text
							Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word
							"biryani" is of older usage in India.[20] A similar theory, that biryani came to India with
							Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect, because there is no record of biryani having existed
							in his native land during that period.[19] According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book
							Biryani, biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian
							subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India.
							Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the
							dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between "pulao"
							and "biryani" being arbitrary.[11][19] According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani
							restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was
							brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[21] There are various apocryphal stories
							dating the invention to Shah Jahan's time but Rana Safvi, the distinguished historian, says she
							could only find a recipe from the later Mughal period, from Bahadur Shah Zafar's time. It is not
							her claim that there was no biryani before that; just that she has not found a recipe. Other
							historians who have gone through texts say that the first references to biryani only appear
							around the 18th century.[22] Difference betw

						Elderly members of the family (above 60 years of age) have various diseases including diabetes,
						high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney disease. For this reason, many people refuse to eat
						anything. Taste also decreases with age. As a result, they became victims of malnutrition. If the
						disease resistance is reduced in winter, there is a risk of getting infected with various
						diseases. Amicron pressure is on him. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the nutrition
